=== Assignment 4: Pretty URLs ===

https://d3rugkzdgfe4op.cloudfront.net/item/k9b430fc

We can have a pretty URL like
https://d3rugkzdgfe4op.cloudfront.net/r/cat

1. Create a Lambda function that would generate a redirect based on URI

2. Create cache behavior /r/* and associate origin-request with the Lambda function

3. Validate
